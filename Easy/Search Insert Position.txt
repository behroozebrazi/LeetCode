class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left, mid, right = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                right = mid - 1
        return left
    
    # Explanation:
    # It limits the searching boundary with left and right index that to reach to the middle index
    # which there is the target value. But if there is no target value in the array, it returns 
    # the left index of the final boundary which is the right position of the target which could 
    # be new position of the target value.
