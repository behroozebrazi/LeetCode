class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        people.sort()
        light, heavy = 0, len(people) - 1
        boats = 0

        while light <= heavy:
            if people[light] + people[heavy] <= limit:
                light += 1
            heavy -= 1
            boats += 1

        return boats

# Explanation:
# First, I sort the given list. Then, I move from begin and end of the list and compare 
# the sum of them with the weight limit. If it is satisfied, I move one step both begin 
# and end indices towards each other. Otherwise, I move one step the end index toward the
# beginning index. I iterate this method and count the loop until the beginning index passes
# the end index. The counted result is the number of boats.
