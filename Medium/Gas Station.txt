# Explanation:
# I use the windows method. Initially, the start station is the first station. If the difference of
# total gases and total costs be negative, the start point is moved to the next index (station) of 
# this interval and reset the tank to zero, because the result of all this interval's indices will 
# be negative to the current index (station).
# If the total difference between gases and costs be negative, so there is no result.
